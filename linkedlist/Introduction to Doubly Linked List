In the realm of data structures, it's essential to grasp the intricacies of doubly linked lists. These data structures are characterized by their ability to efficiently navigate in both forward and backward directions. Before diving into the depths of doubly linked lists, it's beneficial to recap our understanding of linked lists, and their precursor.

Recap on Linked List


Before exploring doubly linked lists, let's refresh our knowledge of linked lists. Linked lists are linear data structures consisting of nodes, each containing data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node. This setup allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions and deletions.

A significant characteristic of singly linked lists is their unidirectional nature, allowing traversal in only one direction: forward. Moving backward, such as going from node 1 to node 3, is not possible because each node in a singly linked list holds two pieces of information - the data (an integer value in this case) and a pointer that indicates the address of the next node. This structure enables efficient forward navigation, but the absence of a backward pointer restricts reverse traversal.

Doubly Linked Lists,  as the name suggests, take the concept of 2-way traversal by introducing two pointers in each node. This enables seamless traversal in both directions, making them a valuable tool for various advanced data structure applications.

Code:

C++
Java
public class Node {
    public int data;      // Data stored in the node
    public Node next;    // Reference to the next node in the list

    // Constructor for a Node with both data and a reference to the next node
    public Node(int data, Node next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    // Constructor for a Node with data and no reference to the next node (end of the list)
    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
The code for Singly Linked List creates a class Node which has two member variables:

int data: This holds the data value that the node stores, which can be of any data type (in this case, an integer).
Node* next: This is a pointer to the next node in the linked list. It allows the nodes to be linked together, forming a sequence.
The class has two constructors:

The first constructor takes both the data and a pointer to the next node as parameters. It initializes the data and the next node accordingly.
The second constructor takes only the data as a parameter and sets it next to nullptr. It could be that this node is the end of the list since there is no reference to the next node. We can append the next of this node later adding more nodes to the linked list.
Here is the code for the doubly linked list

Code:

C++
Java
public class Node {
    public int data;       // Data stored in the node
    public Node next;      // Reference to the next node in the list (forward direction)
    public Node back;      // Reference to the previous node in the list (backward direction)

    // Constructor for a Node with both data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node
    public Node(int data, Node next, Node back) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
        this.back = back;
    }

    // Constructor for a Node with data, and no references to the next and previous nodes (end of the list)
    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
        this.back = null;
    }
}
Node* back; : The introduction of the back pointer is the key change from a singly linked list node. This pointer allows traversal in the backward direction, making it suitable for doubly linked lists.
Constructors: Both constructors have been updated to initialize the new back pointer. In the first constructor, Node(int data1, Node* next1, Node* back1), back is initialized with the provided value. In the second constructor, Node(int data1), the back is initialized to nullptr, just like the next.
These changes differentiate the Node class for a doubly linked list, allowing it to maintain bidirectional links between nodes, as opposed to the unidirectional links in a singly linked list node.
